# Tech Wars

Sydney loves her job. She loves working at a tech startup, she loves the creative culture and most importantly, she loves her coworkers.

But what happens when one day Syd shows up to the office a little late for the morning meeting only to find all of her favorite fellow employees have been infected with a deadly, digitally enhanced virus created by foreign hackers.

Tablet by Tablet, MacBook by MacBook, smartphone by smartphone, the virus spreads through the company’s WiFi network, infecting all of Syd’s coworkers and turning them into biologically augmented Bluetooth beasts hell bent on destroying mankind.

Syd no longer loves her job.

The only way to rid her dream agency of this vile zombie threat is for Syd to hack some sense in to her infected coworkers using what else? Nerf darts dipped in the secret antidote! Clear the room and restore order in the workplace!
